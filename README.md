# SVGNet
This is the official implementation of "SVG-Net: An SVG-based Trajectory Prediction Model". This branch includes our raw
codes and can be used for immediate reproduction of the results. A refactored version of the code will soon be added to 
the [main branch](https://github.com/vita-epfl/SVGNet).
